            <p class="normal-para">We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic
                data, health information, or religious information. Although CogniTensor Technology does not request or
                intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of
                information in your account, such as in a repository. If you store any sensitive personal information on
                our servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, which are in the
                United States.</p>
            <p class="normal-para">We do not intentionally collect information that is stored in your repositories or other free-form
                content inputs. Information in your repositories belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as well
                as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service. CogniTensor Technology
                employees do not access private repositories unless required to for security or maintenance, or for

            <p class="normal-para">If your repository is public, anyone (including us) may view its contents. If you have included private
                or sensitive information in your public repository, such as email addresses, that information may be
                indexed by search engines or used by third parties. In addition, while we do not generally search for
                content in your repositories, we may scan our servers for certain tokens or security signatures.</p>
            <p class="normal-para">If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on CogniTensor Technology. CogniTensor
                Technology does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to
                children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13,
                we will unfortunately have to close your account. We don't want to discourage you from learning to work
                with data or analyze data, but those are the rules. Please see our Terms of Service for information
                about account termination.</p>
            <p class="bold-para">How we share the information we collect</p>
            <p class="normal-para">We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial
                purposes.</p>
            <p class="normal-para">We do not disclose User Personal Information outside CogniTensor Technology, except in the situations
                listed in this section or in the section below on Compelled Disclosure.</p>
            <p class="normal-para">We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users,
                collectively, use CogniTensor Technology, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our
                conferences or events. For example, we may compile statistics on the usage of CogniTensor Technology
                Cloud. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.</p>
            <p class="normal-para">We do not host advertising on CogniTensor Technology. We may occasionally embed content from third party
                sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads. While we try to minimize the amount of ads our
                embedded content contains, we can't always control what third parties show.</p>
            <p class="normal-para">We may share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have
                requested.</p>
            <p class="normal-para">We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of third-party vendors who process it on our
                behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own
                Privacy Statement. Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing,
                network data transmission, and other similar services. When we transfer your data to our vendors under
                Privacy Shield, we remain responsible for it.</p>
            <p class="normal-para">We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such
                change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of
                User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your
                User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor
                any promises we have made in our Privacy Statement or in our Terms of Service.</p>
            <p class="bold-para">Public Information on CogniTensor Technology</p>
            <p class="normal-para">If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of
                Service. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as research
                organizations or archives, to compile public-facing CogniTensor Technology information.</p>
            <p class="normal-para">Your Personal Information, associated with your content, may be gathered by third parties in these
                compilations of CogniTensor Technology data. If you do not want your Personal Information to appear in
                third parties’ compilations of CogniTensor Technology data, please do not make your Personal Information
                publicly available and be sure to configure your email address to be private in your user profile.</p>
            <p class="normal-para">If you would like to compile CogniTensor Technology data, you may only use any public-facing Personal
                Information you gather for the purpose for which our user has authorized it. For example, where a
                CogniTensor Technology user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification
                and attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably
                secure any Personal Information you have gathered from CogniTensor Technology, and to respond promptly
                to complaints, removal requests, and do not contact requests from CogniTensor Technology or CogniTensor
                Technology users.</p>
            <p class="normal-para">Similarly, projects on CogniTensor Technology may include publicly available Personal Information
                collected as part of the collaborative process. In the event that a CogniTensor Technology project
                contains publicly available Personal Information that does not belong to CogniTensor Technology users,
                we will only use that Personal Information for the limited purpose for which it was collected, and we
                will secure that Personal Information as we would secure any User Personal Information. If you have a
                complaint about any Personal Information on CogniTensor Technology, please see our section on resolving
                complaints.</p>

            <p class="normal-para">CogniTensor Technology will not, nor will we allow any third party to, use the Google Analytics tool to
                track our users individually; collect any User Personal Information other than IP address; or correlate
                your IP address with your identity. Google provides further information about its own privacy practices
                and offers a browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking.
            </p>
            <p class="normal-para">Certain pages on our site may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as
                videos, from another site that sets a cookie. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we
                can’t always control what cookies this third party content sets.</p>
            <p class="bold-para">Tracking</p>
            <p class="normal-para">Do Not Track is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to

                services. We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not

                services or permit this kind of third party data collection on CogniTensor Technology for any of our
                users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond
                differently to an individual browser' s Do Not Track setting.</p>
